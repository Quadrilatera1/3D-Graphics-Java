# 3D-Graphics-Java
A simple 3D graphics engine written in Java. Uses the Lightweight Java Game Library API to assist with drawing. 
Currently a work in progress. I intend to add more features and functionality in the future.
Currently it is capable of instantiating points, vectors, and can draw them using the LWJGL.
Implementation of a movable camera is in progress.
